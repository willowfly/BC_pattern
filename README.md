This is shared code and data for the article **Patterns of sound localization/lateralization under bone conduction due to wave interference**.

All shared data are in the folder `resources`.

`./resources/theoretical_model_demo_code/` contains codes for demonstrating more bilateral cochlear response ratio patterns.
These codes run in Matlab environment (Matlab v2023a, Mathworks).

`./resources/demo_audio_files/` contains demo audio files used for the lateralization tracking task. Multiple audio files 
are available, each contains a series of pure tones, with different frequencies. 
We encourage nterested readers listen to the demo audios in a quite environments. It is better to use a personal
desktop to play the audios. For AC stimulus, any type of wired or wireless earphones or headphones were suitable. 
For BC stimulus, a pair of bone conduction earphones (commercials ones are okay) is required.
we recommend placing bone vibrators behind the auricles (at the mastoid), for more effective BC
stimulus, readers can press the vibrators onto the skin using your fingers.

Under AC stimulus, the readers could hearing the sound moving from right to left (the precedence effect). 
Under BC stimulus, the readers have a good possibility of hearing a “swing” sound that moves left and right (back and forth).
